                    <p class="simple-text">React Native is an open source framework for building Android and iOS
                        applications using
                        React and the app platform‚Äôs native capabiles. With React Native, you use JavaScript to
                        access your platform‚Äôs APIs as well as to describe the appearance and behavior of your UI
                        using React components: bundles of reusable, nestable code. You can learn more about React
                        in the next section. But first, let‚Äôs cover how components work in React Native.</p>
                    <li class="li-title">React Fundametals <span class="chapter-text">Chapter 3</span></li>
                    <p class="simple-text">React Native runs on <u>React</u>, a popular open source library for building user
                        interfaces with
                        JavaScript. To make the most of React Native, it helps to understand React itself. This section
                        can get you started or can serve as a refresher course.
                    </p>
                    <p class="simple-text">We‚Äôre going to cover the core concepts behind React:</p>
                    <p class="simple-text"><b>+ components.</b> The rest of this introduction to React uses cats in its
                        examples: friendly, approachable creatures that need names and a cafe to work in.</p>
                    <p class="simple-text"><b>+ JSX.</b> React and React Native use JSX, a syntax that lets you write
                        elements inside JavaScript like so:
                        <Text>Hello, I am your cat!</Text>.
                    </p>
                    <p class="simple-text">The React docs have <u>a comprehensive guide to JSX</u> you can refer to learn even
                        more. Because JSX is JavaScript, you can use variables inside it. Here you are declaring a name
                        for the cat, name, and embedding it with curly braces inside <Text></Text></p>
                    <p class="simple-text"><b>+ props.</b> Props is short for ‚Äúproperties‚Äù. </p>
                    <p class="simple-text"><b>+ state.</b> While you can think of props as arguments you use to
                        configure how
                        components render, state is like a component‚Äôs personal data storage. State is useful for
                        handling data that changes over time or that comes from user interaction. State gives your
                        components memory!</p>
                    <li class="li-title">Handling Text Input <span class="chapter-text">Chapter 4</span></li>
                    <p class="simple-text">TextInput is a Core Component that allows the user to enter text. It has an
                        onChangeText prop that takes a function to be called every time the text changed, and an
                        onSubmitEditing prop that takes a function to be called when the text is submitted.</p>
                    <p class="simple-text">For example, let's say that as the user types, you're translating their words
                        into a different language. In this new language, every single word is written the same way: üçï.
                        So the sentence "Hello there Bob" would be translated as "üçï üçï".</p>
